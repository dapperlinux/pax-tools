# pax-tools

##About
The pax-tools repository contains useful tools which set and manipulate PaX memory protection flags for executables in Dapper Linux.

dapper-paxset sets the initial flags on install for all necessary executables.

paxctl is the program which sets the flags

paxctld is a daemon which maintains flags during normal use of the operating system and program updates.

paxtest is a test suite which verifies that PaX protections are working as intended on the running system.
