paxctld (1.0-4) unstable; urgency=low
  * Fixed a non-security-relevant crash on too-large paxctld.conf files,
    reported by Jurriaan Bremer
  * Fixed the xattrs set by paxctld -- due to the nonintuitivity of PaX
    xattr parsing which differed from some previous marking methods, it
    ended up being the case that if EMUTRAMP was enabled in the kernel,
    all binaries marked with xattrs via paxctld were running with EMUTRAMP
    enabled.  Running the updated version of paxctld will fix the issue
    on binaries listed in paxctld.conf.  This issue was found via an internal
    audit.
