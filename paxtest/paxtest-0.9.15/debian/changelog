    blackhat mode, which does.

  * Removed -etdyn from the Adamantix make file
  * Replaced mprotect() in body.c with pthread calls (which eventually have
    the same result)

    level of protection.
  * Added paxtest result from Gentoo hardened (thanks to Ned Ludd)
  * Added a new Makefile for Gentoo (thanks to Ned Ludd)
  * Fixed spelling errors (thanks to pageexec@freemail.hu)
