	 * mprotect() to override kernel settings, then that is something
	 * the user of this test suite may like to know.
	 *
	 * And yes, I know that this is how UNIX is supposed to work and that
	 * it is a design decision to allow this override. All the more reason
	 * to be honest and open about it and to tell the user why (s)he has
	 * to trade in a bit of security for compatibility.
	 *
	 * But then, it is of course easier to simply disable this mprotect()
	 * call than to fix your kernel and userland.
